2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net LED_reg3[7]_i_3_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin LED_reg3[7]_i_3/O, cell LED_reg3[7]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net new_clk_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin LED_reg2[7]_i_3/O, cell LED_reg2[7]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT LED_reg2[7]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
LED_reg2_reg[0], LED_reg2_reg[1], LED_reg2_reg[2], LED_reg2_reg[3], LED_reg2_reg[4], LED_reg2_reg[5], LED_reg2_reg[6], LED_reg2_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT LED_reg3[7]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
LED_reg3_reg[0], LED_reg3_reg[1], LED_reg3_reg[2], LED_reg3_reg[3], LED_reg3_reg[4], LED_reg3_reg[5], LED_reg3_reg[6], LED_reg3_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
